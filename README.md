### Disassembler
Assembly project

##Implementation

Based off of the skeleton code provided to us by our professor, 

##Limitations

We cannot print the label names that are located in the original .s file, which makes it hard to place label names in the positions that they are called in and located.

##Known issues


##Contributions of each team member

Nour: I-Type, J-Type, comments in code, worked on test cases
Nagham: S-Type, concatenation of immediate values, made sure that program ends at the end of the bin file and not have a specific size, comments in code
Mohammed: R-Type, B-Type, U-Type, added the ABI register names and implemented it in the code, comments in code

We split up all the work between all the members, and we met up numerous times to work on the project together. For each part of the code, each person had some level of input, but the list above shows what each person mainly worked on. Then, we all worked together on the I-Type, U-Type and S-Type functions to make sure that the immediate values were printed out correctly, depending on the sign of the value. Overall, we all looked over each others codes to make sure there were no mistakes and made minor tweaks when required.
